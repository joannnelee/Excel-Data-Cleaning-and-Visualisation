# Excel Data Cleaning and Visualisation

### Project Overview

In this project, data regarding bike sales will be cleaned and then a dashboard will be created. 

### Tools

- Microsoft Excel - Data Cleaning and Visualisation

### Data Cleaning 

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Removal of duplicated
3. Standardisation of data

### Data Visualisation 

#### Pivot Tables
Pivot tables are created so that we can build the visualisations. 

#### Average Income per Purchase

A clustered column chart is used to show the average income of those who purchased a bike and those who did not, and this is split into male and female customers. From the visualisation, induviduals who did not purchase a bike, on average, have a lower income and the average male earns a higher income than the average female.

#### Customer Commute

A line graph is used the visualise the commute distance of bike customers. As the commute distance increases, the number of customers purchasing a bike decreases. This is likely due to the fact that customers travelling further distances may view cycling as an inefficient method of transport.

#### Customer Age Bracket 

A line graph is used to visualise the customer age brackets. We can see that at the extreme ends of the age brackets, the number of induviduals purchasing a bike is very low. This is likely because adolescents may not have the income to purchase a bike and those who are older may not be in the right condition to ride a bike. The number of bikes purhcased is highest in middle aged customers who likely have a reasonable income and are in the right shape to ride a bike.

#### Dashboard

The final dashboard can be viewed below:

Splicers are added which allows you to further filter the visualisations based on different demographics.
